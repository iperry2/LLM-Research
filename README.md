# OPENAI-API

PURPOSE:  This Repo serves as a reference database for my thesis research conducted at Middle Tennessee State University (2024). The purpose of the experiment is to use various AI API to analyze scientific literature.  Using Azure Cloud, we plan to create a team of AI agents trained on specific areas of Astronomy.  The projects in this database are snippets of code written to test different analysis techniques and do not represent the project in full.
