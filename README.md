# OPENAI-API

PURPOSE:  Documentation of first experiment done on querying a panda dataframe.  PDF's used in first experiment are in Sample.PDFs.zip.  PDF's are read in, normalized, embedded and put into a database.  Then database is queried upon.  Cosine similarity can be performed and specific questions can be asked on the dataset.

METHODS:  

ISSUES:  Context window is an issue in this experiment.  I am only able to feed roughly 25 "chunks" max into a query to fit inside the context window of the chosen LLM.

PREREQUISITES: 

HOW TO USE:
