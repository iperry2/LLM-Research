In original form ZZZ ABSTRACT In this work, we revisit the relationship between [O III] line width w90(as the indicator of AGN outflow velocity) and the radio emissioninRQQsbyemployingalargesampleofTypeIquasars(37,000)selectedfromtheSloanDigitalSkySurvey(SDSS) DataReleaseSixteen.

Summary 3: 
orrelation between w90and radio emission in SDSS RQQs remains significant . This intrinsic link supports that the [OIII]outflowsinquasars could make a dominant contribution to radio emission .

Processing chunk from index 2000 to 2500
Summary 4: 
the star-formation rates traced by the flux ratio of [Ne V]/[O II] emission lines display no dependence on w90after controlling the effects of black hole mass, quasar luminosity, Eddington ratio and redshift . This suggests that the stronger radio emission in RQQs with larger radio emission could not be attributed to outflow enhanced (positive feedback) star formation in the hosts .

etric [O III] 5007 emission line profile (Osterbrock & Ferland 2006) have been commonly found . The quasar-driven disc winds (Proga 2007) are usually proposed to be the driving mechanism for these outflows in RQQs via interacting with the surrounding gas at various spatial scales . Meanwhile, the generated shock in such interaction could accelerate electrons and produce synchrotron emission(e.g.

Historical researches suggested that [O III]-traced outflows and the extended radio emission are co-spatial, implying a shock-relatedoriginoftheradioradiation . Furthermore, the correlation between the width of [OIII] and radio luminosity has been found in literatures for radio-quiet AGN and RQQs .

Introducci  on The term “AGN” stands for Active Galactic Nucleus, which refers to the compact region at the center of a galaxy that arecharacterized by their significant and unusual activity . It is believed that this high activity is due to the presence of SMBH that is accreting massive black hole (SMBH).

Processing chunk from index 4500 to 5000
Summary 110: 
the central engine of the AGN is a SMBH, an idea originally proposed in the mid-1960s by Salpeter [3], Zel’dovich and Novikov [4], and Lynden-Bell [5]. Since the Seyfert’s observations, in the 1940s [6], through Schmidt’s 3C 273 radio source in 1963 [7], the number of apparently distinct objects has increased .

Summary 554: 
the maximum redshift reached by SNe Ia observations is z = 2.26 [17], while the CMB radiation is observed at z= 1100 . Therefore, it is crucial to probe the Universe in the intermediate epochs between these two redshifts to shed light on this tension .

Summary 556: 
QSOs have recently attracted more and more interest among the cosmological community [20, 38– 45] since they are observed up to z = 7.642 [46] at redshifts much higher than the maximum redshift at which SNe Ia are observed . The most common efforts to standardise QSO as cosmology candles are based on the Risaliti-Lusso (RL) relation between the logarithms of the Ultraviolet .

In this scenario, the UV emission of the accretion disk is then reprocessed in X-rays from an external region of relativistic electrons via the inverse Compton effect . However, this mechanism still requires a comprehensive understanding to account for the stability . This stability requires an efficient energy transfer between the c-ray emission .

In recent years, several studies utilised the RL relation to identifying QSOs as potential cosmological standard candles . Usually, they are used in conjunction with other cosmology probes .

Processing chunk from index 8500 to 9000
Summary 561: 
a sub-sample of QSOs, a ‘gold’ sample, presents the optimal compromise between reduced intrinsic dispersion and a sufficient number of sources to be used as a standalone probe . We follow a similar approach to the one of finding a standard candle in the GRB domain [27, 33, 64, 65, 65–73], leading to the definition of the ‘Platinum’ GRB sample .

Processing chunk from index 9000 to 9500
Summary 562: 
In the case of GRBs, the morphological feature that drives a standard candle is the plateau emission with peculiar characteristics . The key feature under consideration here is the obedience to a linear relation between the logarithmic fluxes ( FXFUV). This relation is the observer frame relation corresponding to the establisher frame relation.

Additionally, a sub-sample of low-redshift QSOs is included, featuring UV observations from the International Ultraviolet Explorer .

Summary 570: 
To obtain this QSO sample suitable for cosmological analyses, possible observational biases have been thoroughly inspected and removed . First, only measurements with a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio S/N 1 are retained . Then, QSOs that manifest the presence of extinction are removed to account for UV reddening and contamination of the host galaxy.

This initial sample is composed of the largest number of data points possible while still adhering to the criteria in Eq.

Each stage plays a pivotal role in ensuring the comprehensiveness and rigour of the review process . The planning phase is foundational to the entire review process, as it involves formulating a set of precise and specific research questions . A detailed protocol is also developed during this stage, outlining the appropriate methodologies that will be adopted to carry out the review [27].
